In this lab, you will write a program to hash words. 
You will implement the three different hash functions described below and one hash
function of your choosing. Use separate chaining for collision resolution. 
You can make use of the Java Collections Framework's fundamental data structures
in your implementations, e.g. List or Vector. Place your HashTable class in a file
named HashTable.java.

<h2>Hash Functions</h2>
You need to implement these three hash functions that take String keys. For each function,
you should calculate the value for the key and bring the result into the range 
of your hash table. You also need to provide your own hash function that takes a String 
as the key. Refer to page 262-264 of the CLRS text for ideas. Table sizes is to be
chosen by you.
<ol>
<li> This hash function adds up the ASCII values of the characters in the key. </li>

<li> This hash function uses the first three characters of the key, 
therefore all keys are assumed to be at least three characters long.
The value for a key <i>k</i> is calculated as: 
k[0] + 27 * k[1] + 729 * k[2]
where 27 represents the number of letters in the English alphabet, plus the blank, 
and 729 is 27<sup>2</sup>. </li>

<li> This hash function uses all characters in the key and calculates <br>
&#8721; <sub> i=0,...,keysize-1 </sub> k[keysize - i - 1] * 37 <sup>i</sup>.  
You can compute this polynomial function (of 37) by using Horner's rule, for example: <br>
h = k0 + (37 * k1) + (37 <sup>2</sup> * k2) can be computed recursively 
by h = ( (k2) * 37 + k1 ) * 37 + k0. <br>
</li>

</ol>

<h2>Methods you need include in your HashTable class</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>void print( )</b> - Print the hash table in the following format. Each 
array location will be printed on a separate line. The line will start with the 
number of the array location followed by a : and followed by one tab. You will 
then print each word stored at that hash array location separated by a , and a 
single space. After all words at that hash array location are printed, you will 
output a return. <a href="sample_hash.out">Here</a> 
is a sample of what your output should look like</li>
<li><b>void processFile( String filename ) </b>- Add all of the words 
in the file specified as "filename" to the hash table. 
<a href="test1.txt">Here</a> is a sample input file. Use push back to insert each 
of the words into the list at the hash location that the words hashes to.</li>
<li><b> void printStats( ) </b>- Print the hash statistics: total number 
of collisions (keep track of this during insertions) the
length of the longest list, and the average length of all lists.
</li></ul>
<br>
Your main method (in Main.java) should take the input file as a command line
parameter, insert the values in the file into the hash table, 
print out the hash table to the screen, and finally print the stats
immediately before returning from main. <br>
<br>

For further testing, you can use the following dictionary input files:
 <a href="dict5.txt">dict5.txt</a>, <a href="dict7.txt">dict7.txt</a>.
 
<h3>Open Addressing Hashing</h3>
Write a program in a file named OpenAddressCollisionTests.java (file should have 
a main method), that randomly generates an input sequence of integer keys and 
performs collision resolution in an open addressing hashing scheme using the 
following probing sequences: linear probing, quadratic probing, and cubic probing. 
Cubic probing is simply using an offset of i<sup>3</sup> away from the original 
collision location, versus i for linear and i<sup>2</sup> for quadratic. 
Then run some tests varying table sizes and maximum number of elements inserted 
into the hash table to see when the number of collisions dominates the cost of inserts.
Use table sizes that are prime numbers and maximum number of elements inserted at 
25%, 50%, 75%, and 90% of the size of the hash table.
